# Bellevue-Portfolio-
Include all projects from my time at Bellevue University as well as some personal projects 

This repository contains multiple projects spanning various domains such as machine learning, application development, healthcare analytics, and complaint handling. Each folder corresponds to a specific project with distinct objectives and tools. Below is a detailed description of each project.

Project Descriptions
Air3550

Overview: A project related to aviation or airline scheduling. It involves flight scheduling, pricing and printing of a boarding pass.
Tools/Technologies: C#.

Binary-Search-Tree-master

Overview: A classic implementation of the Binary Search Tree (BST) algorithm, often used for searching and sorting data efficiently.
Tools/Technologies: Data structures and algorithms implemented in C++.

Fork-Project-master

Overview: This program demonstrates inter-process communication (IPC) using pipes in a Linux/UNIX environment. It uses a parent-child process setup created via fork(). The program calculates the Collatz Conjecture (also known as the "3n + 1 problem") for a given positive integer input using two pipes to exchange data between the parent and child processes.
Tools/Technologies: C.

HousingMarket

Overview: A project focused on housing market analysis, predicting housing prices, or real estate trends.
Tools/Technologies: Machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees), Python libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn.

Meteorite Landing

Overview: Likely involves analyzing meteorite landing data, including geographical and scientific insights.
Tools/Technologies: Python, Jupyter Notebook, and APIs for geospatial data such as OpenWeatherMap or NASA data sources.

MovieRecommender

Overview: A recommendation system for movies based on user preferences, ratings, or collaborative filtering methods.
Tools/Technologies: Python, machine learning algorithms (e.g., content-based or collaborative filtering), libraries like Scikit-learn and Pandas.

NationalHealthCare

Overview: A healthcare analytics project that may involve national healthcare datasets, trends, or policy evaluations.
Tools/Technologies: Python, healthcare data analysis, visualization tools (e.g., Tableau or Matplotlib).

Predicting Churn

Overview: A predictive modeling project for identifying customer churn in businesses, particularly in telecom or subscription-based industries.
Tools/Technologies: Machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest), Python libraries like Scikit-learn and NumPy.

TSA Complaint

Overview: A project likely analyzing TSA (Transportation Security Administration) complaint data for insights into user experiences and service performance.
Tools/Technologies: Text analysis, natural language processing (NLP), and Python tools like NLTK or SpaCy.

WeatherAPP

Overview: A weather application that retrieves and displays weather forecasts using APIs like OpenWeatherMap.
Tools/Technologies: Python or JavaScript, API integration, and front-end frameworks like Flask or React.
