# Housing Predictive Analysis and Data Insights

## Overview

This capstone project focuses on leveraging data science techniques to extract insights, build predictive models, and communicate findings effectively. 
It integrates multiple datasets and uses machine learning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to address the project's objectives.

The project follows a structured approach:

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Ensures datasets are accurate and consistent.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Identifies patterns, trends, and relationships in the data.
Modeling: Implements predictive models and evaluates their performance.
Visualization and Communication: Uses visualizations to convey insights to technical and non-technical audiences.

## Key Features
Data Cleaning:
Handles missing values and outliers.
Standardizes columns for consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Correlation analysis and visualizations.
Identifies significant features for modeling.
Predictive Modeling:
Implements machine learning algorithms for predictions.
Evaluates models using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R².
Visualization:
Uses graphs, heatmaps, and scatter plots to illustrate findings.
Interactive Components:
Designed for engaging technical professionals and stakeholders.

## Technologies Used
